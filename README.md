# Fine-Grain Vision

**Content-adaptive slice pooling vs fixed patch grids** for fine-grained visual structure.

Self-contained PyTorch experiments. No external datasets required — all tasks are synthetic and reproducible.

> Architectural comparison at tiny scale (depth 3, dim 64). Numbers are **not** comparable to production VLMs (MoonViT, Qwen-VL, …).

### Transolver3 multimodal (product direction)

**Architecture source of truth:** [`docs/NORTH_STAR.md`](docs/NORTH_STAR.md).
It defines the locked full-resolution `X ↔ Slice ↔ H` graph, the limits of the
active-inference claim, all six ports as boundary conditions, and the generation
gates. See [`docs/README.md`](docs/README.md) for document status.

**Not** permanent vision slice tokens into the LLM.  
**Yes** full-res fields + temporary shared workspace \(U\) (Read/Write) + deslice
write-back; each modality keeps topology. See
[`results/published/TRANSOLVER3_MULTIMODAL.md`](results/published/TRANSOLVER3_MULTIMODAL.md),
[`NATIVE_MULTIMODAL_WORKSPACE.md`](results/published/NATIVE_MULTIMODAL_WORKSPACE.md).  
Code: `fine_grain/cross_modal_slice_loop.py` (`B_xmodal`).  
Legacy `SliceFrontend` (B tokens) = ablation/history only.

## Question

Modern VLM vision stacks remove *resize* but keep a **fixed patch grid**. Is that grid what buries small structure, or is the real bottleneck effective resolution / re-acquisition?

This repo measures both sides under a matched token budget:

| Arm | Mechanism |
|-----|-----------|
| `patch4` / `patch8` / `patch16` | ViT-style patchify + MHSA (baseline; deliberately **not** weakened) |
| `slice` / `slice_loc_nogumbel` | Transolver++-style soft assignment + mass-normalized pooling |
| `slice_*_st` | + Stiefel directions via Newton–Schulz (Muon coefficients) |
| controls | `slice_const`, `slice_sum`, Gumbel on/off, sparse deslice write |

## Key findings (pre-registered where noted)

| ID | Result |
|----|--------|
| **P1/P4** | Patch accuracy tracks **s/p** (object size / patch size), not absolute s. Raising resolution buys fine grain at 4× tokens. |
| **P6** | Thin **lines** survive patch grids; **point-like** needles do not — fine ≠ small. |
| **P7** | **Mass normalization** is the size-invariance mechanism (not per-pixel tokens alone). |
| **Oracle** | Glyph memorization failure is largely **optimization** (Gumbel noise), not expressivity. |
| **Line recon (fair)** | RGB pure-red 1px polylines, res 64, 600 steps. **slice** Dice **1.00** by ~step 100. **patch16** with fair head `Linear→unpatchify`: Dice **0.215** (IoU 0.12, recall 0.88). Legacy bilinear head was **~0.15** — fair head helps a little, **does not close the gap**. Stiefel is mainly **anti-collapse**, not recon magic. See [`results/published/line_recon_64_fair.json`](results/published/line_recon_64_fair.json). |
| **Caveats** | (1) Prefer **RGB** over luma (luma≈0.299 shortcut on red lines). (2) Default patch recon head is unpatchify; `--patch-decoder bilinear` is legacy only. (3) Spectrum wipe figure uses **patch mean** as illustration — real stem is learned `Conv2d(k=p,s=p)`; claim is **capacity/SNR falls with s/p**, not “inevitably wipes 1px lines.” |

## Next experiment: native Slice-MoT VLM

The first realistic vision-language integration is now preregistered in
[`docs/native_slice_mot_vlm_experiment.md`](docs/native_slice_mot_vlm_experiment.md).
It replaces frozen-LLM frontend probes with a six-layer model trained jointly
from random initialization: a persistent full-resolution point field and a
language stream communicate at every depth through modality-specific
Mixture-of-Transformers experts. The primary decision gate requires at least
64M loss-bearing public-data tokens before an architecture conclusion.

This is an experiment design, not a reported result.

## Install

```bash
python -m venv .venv
# Windows: .venv\Scripts\activate
source .venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
pip install transformers modelscope tokenizers
# optional editable install
pip install -e .
```

**Model weights / caches:** use **ModelScope on D:** (not C:, not HF if blocked):

```bash
set ML_CACHE_ROOT=D:\ml_cache
python scripts/train_vlm_frontends.py --mode smoke --prefer local
# or try: --prefer gemma / --prefer pythia  (ModelScope download → D:\ml_cache)
```

GPU (CUDA) is optional but recommended for full sweeps.

## Quickstart

```bash
# unit tests (CPU, seconds)
python tests/test_deslice_scatter_and_gate.py
# or: pytest -q

# needle size sweep (tiny default steps for smoke)
python scripts/train_benchmark.py --task needle --arms patch4,slice --steps 50 --seeds 1

# glyph shape task
python scripts/train_benchmark.py --task glyph --arms patch4,slice_loc_nogumbel --steps 1500

# line reconstruction @ 64^2 (fair patch head = unpatchify by default)
python scripts/line_recon.py --arms slice_loc_nogumbel,patch16 --res 64 --steps 600 --rgb
# legacy unfair patch head (bilinear + 1x1), for comparing old numbers only
python scripts/line_recon.py --arms patch16 --patch-decoder bilinear --rgb

# optional: materialize kinks dataset to disk
python scripts/build_kinks_dataset.py --out data/kinks256 --n_train 6000 --n_val 600

# A/B/C vision → frozen small LLM (ModelScope/local tinylm on D:\ml_cache)
set ML_CACHE_ROOT=D:\ml_cache
python scripts/train_vlm_frontends.py --mode sweep --prefer local --res 32 --T_list 64 32 16 --steps 60 --amp

## Design notes

- **Baseline fidelity (classification):** patch arms get no extras (no RoPE freebies). `patch4` is *stronger* than real MoonViT (which pixel-shuffles 2×2 before projection) — intentional for classification sweeps.
- **Line-recon head (dense):** slice uses per-point logits (full HxW). Patch default is **unpatchify** so within-patch structure is expressible; do not cite bilinear-head Dice as pure encoder failure.
- **Patchify ≠ mean pool:** stem is `Conv2d(3 → dim-2, kernel=p, stride=p)` — a learned linear map over the p²×3 window. Mean pooling is only a special case; high-frequency directions *can* survive in the subspace of the kernel. The hard claim is **s/p-limited capacity/SNR and addressing**, not spectral annihilation.
- **Slice stack:** mass-norm soft pool (**read**) + optional **sparse deslice write** (primary soft-scatter fix: `deslice_topk` / threshold). Optional Qwen gate: residual-dependent post-attn form (arXiv:2505.06708) and/or residual-stream `σ(W x) ⊙ mix`. Optional `recur_T` multi-pass is **fallback only**. Stride-1 DW 3×3 for locality without downsampling.
- **`G ≤ C` (slice collapse geometry):** slice/query directions live in \(\mathbb{R}^{C}\) with \(C =\) `heads × dim_head` (or full `dim`). At most **C** independent axes. If **`slice_num G > C`** (e.g. 64 queries in 32-d), high `cos_tok` / dead slots are **rank-forced**, not only optim — lower **G** or raise **C**. Defaults here: `G=32`, `C=4×16=64`. See module docstring in `fine_grain/models.py`.
- **Current published-result scope:** real OCR/characters are not yet a published
  result (glyph = 4 geometric shapes only). The native Slice-MoT VLM document
  above defines the next experiment; it does not retroactively extend the claims
  of the synthetic benchmarks.
